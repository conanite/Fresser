  Cell fixed attributes: capacity, x, y, z

  Cell variable attributes:
    food:    []
    agent:   
    surface:

  Agent:
    - belongs to a cell
    - fat:                # negative means hungry, positive means don't need food
    - thirst:
    - sickness:
    - age:
    - fertility:

  variables: hunger, thirst, sickness, age, fatness, fertility

organism has
 - position
 - fat

behaviours:

Reproduction
 - based on energy store
 - based on available food
 - based on comptetition for food
 - based on free space
 - based on weather
 - a/sexual
 - number of offspring
 - energy donation to each offspring
 - DNA integrity (random check), correct insertions
 - DNA integrity (random check), correct deletions
 - DNA integrity (random check), correct in-place modifications

Movement
 - roots vs legs
 - herding
 - seek food
 - avoid predators
 - seek warmth
 - seek terrain

Vision
 - each vision module adds vision

EnergyAcquisition
 - sunlight
 - preying
   - select prey based on appearance
   - select prey based on size
   - exclude prey based on appearance
   -
 - defence
   - thick skin
   - water storage
   - spikes
   - poison
   - camouflage
   - predator avoidance based on appearance
   - predator avoidance based on movement
   - predator avoidance based on size

NutrientAcquisition
 - roots
 - preying

DNA mutations
 - change an entry
 - delete an entry
 - insert an entry


---------------

Nutrients:
 - water    (nutrient transport, cooling)
 - sodium   (required for movement behaviours)
 - nitrogen (required for movement behaviours, digestion of prey)
 - potassium
 - phosphorus
 - calcium   (plant structure, animal structure, movement, digestion)
 - magnesium (essential for photosynthesis)
 - chlorine  (digestion, plant structure)
 - zinc
 - iron      (nutrient transport)
 - iodine    (growth, thinking)
 - selenium  (remove excess nutrients)
